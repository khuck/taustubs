This is work in progress...

The idea behind tau_stubs is that an application can have permanent TAU
instrumentation in it, but not have TAU as a build dependency.
Basically, the instrumentation relies on function pointers that are 
initialized to NULL, and then set at program start if the TAU_xxx
functions are defined in the program space (i.e. if the TAU preload
libraries are used).

The only confirmed working example is the C++ example.
